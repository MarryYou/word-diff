# word-diff

word-diff is a word based inline string diff library, based on John Resig's [Javascript Diff Algorithm][0]. Focus is put on producing comprehensible diff instead of a compact one.
The diff consists of the minimal count of items describing changes in the string. Both the original and the changed string can be reproduced from the diff. Whitespace-only differences are ignored.

## Installation

### Installing word-diff
``` bash
  $ [sudo] npm install word-diff
```
  
## Usage
This module can be used to generate word based diff for two strings.

``` js
    var worddiff = require('word-diff');

    var diff = worddiff.diffString('what a great time to be alive', 'how great it is to be alive')

    // diff:
    [
        {'remove': 'what a ', 'add': 'how '},
        {'text': 'great '},
        {'remove': 'time ', 'add': 'it is '},
        {'text': 'to be alive'}
    ]
```
